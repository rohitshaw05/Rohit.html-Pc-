      </h2>
      <p>
        A pollutant is a waste material that pollutes air, water, or soil. Three
        factors determine the severity of a pollutant: its chemical nature, the
        concentration and the persistence.

      </h2>
      <p>
        Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment
        that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of chemical
        substances or energy, such as noise, heat or light. Pollutants, the
        components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or
        naturally occurring contaminants. Pollution is often classed as point
        source or nonpoint source pollution. In 2015, pollution killed 9 million
        people in the world. Major forms of pollution include: Air pollution,
        light pollution, littering, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil
        contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, visual
        pollution, water pollution.

      </h2>
      <p>
        Pollution affects humans in every part of the world.
        An October 2017 study by the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health found that global pollution,
        specifically toxic air, water, soil and workplaces, kills nine million people annually, which is triple the
        number of deaths caused by AIDS,
        tuberculosis and malaria combined, and 15 times higher than deaths caused by wars and other forms of human
        violence.The study concluded that
        "pollution is one of the great existential challenges of the Anthropocene era. Pollution endangers the
        stability
        of the Earth's support systems and threatens the continuing survival of human societies."
        Adverse air quality can kill many organisms, including humans. Ozone pollution can cause respiratory disease,
        cardiovascular disease, throat inflammation,
        chest pain, and congestion. A 2010 analysis estimated that 1.2 million people died prematurely each year in
        China alone because of air pollution.China's high smog levels can damage the human body and cause various
        diseases.In 2019, air pollution caused 1.67 million deaths in India (17.8% of total deaths nationally).Studies
        have estimated that the number of people killed annually in the United States could be over 50,000.A study
        published in 2022 in GeoHealth concluded that energy-related fossil fuel emissions in the United States cause
        46,900–59,400 premature deaths each year and PM2.5-related illness and death costs the nation $537–$678
        billion
        annually.
        In 2019, water pollution caused 1.4 million premature deaths.Contamination of drinking water by untreated
        sewage
        in developing countries is an issue, for example, over 732 million Indians (56% of the population) and over 92
        million Ethiopians (92.9% of the population) do not have access to basic sanitation.In 2013 over 10 million
        people in India fell ill with waterborne illnesses in 2013, and 1,535 people died, most of them children.As of
        2007, nearly 500 million Chinese lack access to safe drinking water.
        Acute exposure to certain pollutants can have short and long term effects. Oil spills can cause skin
        irritations
        and rashes. Noise pollution induces hearing loss, high blood pressure, stress, and sleep disturbance. Mercury
        has been linked to developmental deficits in children and neurologic symptoms. Older people are significantly
        exposed to diseases induced by air pollution. Those with heart or lung disorders are at additional risk.
        Children and infants are also at serious risk. Lead and other heavy metals have been shown to cause
        neurological
        problems, intellectual disabilities and behavioural problems.Chemical and radioactive substances can cause
        cancer and birth defects.

      <p>
        The health impacts of pollution have both direct and lasting social consequences. A 2021 study found that
        exposure to pollution causes an increase in violent crime.A 2019 paper linked pollution to adverse school
        outcomes for children.A number of studies show that pollution has an adverse effect on the productivity of
        both
        indoor and outdoor workers.
