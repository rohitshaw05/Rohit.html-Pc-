                    Soil Pollution has gradually become a major challenge that we need to
                    overcome for establishing a healthy environment. Weathering of earthâ€™s
                    crusts by different processes leads to the formation of soil that
                    accumulates over the centuries. The soil is the home for a large part of
                    bacterial biodiversity and other microscopic and macroscopic living
                    organisms. However, let us consider our very own country India. Indian
                    economy is largely dependent on agriculture. Thus, we Indians give very
                    high priority to the development of agriculture, fisheries, and livestock.
                    Therefore, for surplus production, it is very important to protect crops
                    from any type of damage that occurs due to insects, weeds, rodents and
                    other crop diseases. So, how do we protect crops? The very obvious answer
                    is pesticides and herbicides. However, do you know these pesticides and
                    herbicides is a leading cause of soil pollution? Therefore, it is very
                    important to judiciously use pesticides because it contains lots of
                    different harmful chemicals. Therefore, to improve soil and prevent soil
                    pollution it is important to limit the use of pesticides and herbicides

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soil pollution refers to anything that causes contamination of soil and
                    degrades the soil quality. It occurs when the pollutants causing the
                    pollution reduce the quality of the soil and convert the soil inhabitable
                    for microorganisms and macro organisms living in the soil. Soil
                    contamination or soil pollution can occur either because of human
                    activities or because of natural processes. However, mostly it is due to
                    human activities. The soil contamination can occur due to the presence of
                    chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, ammonia, petroleum hydrocarbons,
                    lead, nitrate, mercury, naphthalene, etc in an excess amount. The primary
                    cause of soil pollution is a lack of awareness in general people. Thus,
                    due to many different human activities such as overuse of pesticides the
                    soil will lose its fertility. Moreover, the presence of excess chemicals
                    will increase the alkalinity or acidity of soil thus degrading the soil
                    quality. This will in turn cause soil erosion. This soil erosion refers to
                    soil pollution.

                    Soil pollution can be natural or due to human activity. However, it mostly
                    boils down to the activities of the human that causes the majority of soil
                    pollution such as heavy industries, or pesticides in agriculture.
                    Pesticides Before World War II, the chemical nicotine chemical present in
                    the tobacco plants was used as the pest controlling substance in
                    agricultural practices. However, DDT was found to be extremely useful for
                    malaria control and as pest control of many insects during World War II.
                    Therefore, it was used for controlling many diseases. Hence, post-war,
                    people started using it as pest control in agriculture for killing
                    rodents, weeds, insects, etc and avoiding the damages due to these pests.
                    However, everyone gradually the adverse effects of this chemical which led
                    to the ban of this chemical in many parts of the world including India.
                    Moreover, pests became resistance to DDT due to the chemicals regular use.
                    Hence this led to the introduction of other harmful chemicals such as
                    Aldrin and Dieldrin. Pesticides are synthetic toxic chemicals that
                    definitely kill different types of pests and insects causing damage to
                    agriculture but it has many ecological repercussions. They are generally
                    insoluble in water and non-biodegradable. Therefore, these chemicals will
                    not gradually decompose and keep on accumulating in the soil. Therefore,
                    the concentration of these chemicals will increase when the transfer of
                    these chemicals take place from lower to higher trophic level via the food
                    chain. Hence, it will cause many metabolic and physiological disorders in
                    humans.

                <p>
                    Soil pollution is not only the problem in India but it is a global
                    problem. It causes harmful effect on the soil and the environment at
                    large. Contamination of soil will decrease the agricultural output of a
                    land. Major soil pollution after effects are: Inferior Crop Quality It can
                    decrease the quality of the crop. Regular use of chemical fertilizers,
                    inorganic fertilizers, pesticides will decrease the fertility of the soil
                    at a rapid rate and alter the structure of the soil. This will lead to
                    decrease in soil quality and poor quality of crops. Over the time the soil
                    will become less productive due to the accumulation of toxic chemicals in
                    large quantity. Harmful Effect on Human Health It will increase the
                    exposure to toxic and harmful chemicals thus increasing health threats to
                    people living nearby and on the degraded land. Living, working or playing
                    in the contaminated soil can lead to respiratory diseases, skin diseases,
                    and other diseases. Moreover, it can cause other health problems. Water
                    Sources Contamination The surface run-off after raining will carry the
                    polluted soil and enter into different water resource. Thus, it can cause
                    underground water contamination thereby causing water pollution. This
                    water after contamination is not fit for human as well as animal use due
                    to the presence of toxic chemicals. Negative Impact on Ecosystem and
                    Biodiversity Soil pollution can cause an imbalance of the ecosystem of the
                    soil. The soil is an important habitat and is the house of different type
                    of microorganisms, animals, reptiles, mammals, birds, and insects. Thus,
                    soil pollution can negatively impact the lives of the living organisms and
                    can result in the gradual death of many organisms. It can cause health
                    threats to animals grazing in the contaminated soil or microorganisms
                    residing in the soil.
