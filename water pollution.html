                <p>
                    When various natural water bodies on the Earth, such as lakes, rivers,
                    underground aquatic reservoirs, seas, and oceans are subjected to
                    contamination from man-made activities, such a phenomenon is termed as
                    water pollution. Artificial chemicals, pollutants, particles, and other
                    objects making their way to these water bodies is what results in their
                    pollution.

                    We are not only responsible for giving our kids a good education and a
                    great life, but there’s also a dire need to make the next generation aware
                    of the environment. The impact that our certain actions can have on one of
                    our prized resources – water – is a lesson kid should learn when they are
                    young. There is a necessity for a learning to be present around water
                    pollution for kids.

                    <em id="H"> Types of pollution </em>
                </h2>

                <p>Pollution can be categorized into many types which are as follows:</p>

                <h3>A. Pollution By Foreign Nutrients</h3>

                <p>
                    When entities containing high quantities of nutrients, such as
                    fertilizers, domestic wastewater and sewage, enter the water bodies, these
                    support the growth of various types of weed, algae, and other plants that
                    are harmful to the water body. They not only render the water unfit for
                    human consumption but also reduce the oxygen level, causing harm to the
                    existing flora and fauna.
                </p>
                <h3>B. Pollution of Surface Water</h3>
                <p>
                    Artificial chemicals, waste products from various industries and
                    factories, insecticides, and pesticides from the runoff of the farms, flow
                    out of the area and mix with surface water in the surrounding areas.

            </sction>
            <section>

                <h3>C. Pollution Leading to Reduced Oxygen Levels</h3>
                <p>
                    Naturally occurring water bodies contain a balanced amount of
                    micro-organisms that contribute to the presence of oxygen in the water,
                    termed as aerobic and their complements, anaerobic. When wastage that is
                    biodegradable enters water bodies, anaerobic organisms find an affinity
                    towards them, leading to a burst of their growth. This leads to the
                    destruction of aerobic organisms and substantial reduction in the oxygen
                    levels of the water.
                </p>
                <h3>D. Pollution of Underground Reservoirs</h3>
                <p>
                    Groundwater is a major source of water across many areas away from rivers
                    or purified water supply. However, usage of chemical pesticides and
                    insecticides in the farms causes them to seep through the ground and
                    pollute the underground reserves. At times, these may reach the outer
                    lakes and rivers, and pollute them too.

                <p>
                    There is no one reason to be considered as the cause of water pollution.
                    There are in fact many. From industries to household activities…water
                    pollution is a big problem caused by every day trivial things of life

                    <li>
                        <b>Pollution from Industrial Sources</b>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Industries and factories generate a lot of waste which majorly consists
                        of harmful elements such as lead, sulphur, and mercury which are
                        extremely poisonous and are mixed with fresh water bodies.
                    </p>
                    <li>Pollution from Households</li>
                    <p>
                        Everyday sewage from cities is dumped into oceans. These might be
                        chemically treated beforehand, but they do contain bacteria and
                        chemicals that are harmful.
                    </p>
                    <li>Pollution Generated from Mining Activities</li>
                    <p>
                        Certain countries, such as Canada, are highly affected by water
                        pollution due to mining activities. Mines of coals and other metals
                        could come in contact with surface water or other bodies, creating
                        harmful polluting conditions.
                    </p>
                    <li>Pollution from Garbage</li>
                    <p>
                        Nearly all countries with ineffective waste management systems dump
                        their garbage and waste into the oceans. From household garbage to
                        general civic waste, all enter the oceanic water bodies and pollutes
                        them tremendously.
                    </p>
                    <li>Pollution from Oil Spills</li>
                    <p>
                        Major oil spills, like the Deepwater Horizon or Exxon Valdes, can create
                        havoc in the oceans and lead to extreme amounts of loss in marine life.
                        It can also cause irreparable damage to the marine ecosystem that can be
                        difficult to reverse.
                    </p>
                    <li>Pollution from Fossil Fuel Combustion</li>
                    <p>
                        Burning coal and other fossil fuels lead to aerial waste products and
                        ash, which combine with water vapour. These result in acid rain and
                        further increase global warming, both of which directly impact the
                        pollution in water bodies.
                    </p>
                    <li>Pollution from Farms</li>
                    <p>
                        Chemical fertilizers and pesticides used by farmers seep through the
                        ground and affect the underground water reservoirs directly. These can
                        further pollute rivers and canals as well, leading to a harmful water
                        supply for humans and other creatures.
                    </p>
                    <li>Pollution from Landfills</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Landfills might be away from water bodies but in the course of rainfall,
                    the pollutants of the landfill can find their way to the nearest water
                    body and pollute it.

                <p>
                    It is necessary to make kids aware of the effects of water pollution, as
                    water pollution is now a raging topic and if soon preventive actions are
                    not taken, the coming generation won’t have clean water to drink.

                <h3>A. Food Chain Destruction</h3>
                <p>
                    Water pollution can result in the destruction of marine life or a
                    particular animal type within an ecosystem. Furthermore, if any other
                    animal ends up consuming an infected animal, the infection progresses
                    further and further through the food chain. This results in a huge
                    infection throughout the chain and heavily impacts the population of the
                    fauna.
                </p>
                <h3>B. Loss of Marine Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Oil spills can ruin an entire ecosystem and leave a huge section of the
                    ocean completely lifeless. These spills could reach shores and cause
                    further damage to wildlife and birds that depend on the marine life for
                    sustenance.
                </p>
                <h3>C. Disease Outbreaks</h3>
                <p>
                    Polluted water can make its way back to the household and result in people
                    being infected with bacteria and viruses. Most diseases such as hepatitis
                    are transmitted through polluted water itself. An entire city can suffer
                    from a massive outbreak of typhoid or cholera by pollution of water.
