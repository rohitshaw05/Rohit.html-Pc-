                    unwanted or excessive sound that can have deleterious effects on human
                    health and environmental quality. Noise pollution is commonly generated
                    inside many industrial facilities and some other workplaces, but it also
                    comes from highway, railway, and airplane traffic and from outdoor
                    construction activities.

                </h2>

                <p>
                    Sound waves are vibrations of air molecules carried from a noise source to
                    the ear. Sound is typically described in terms of the loudness (amplitude)
                    and the pitch (frequency) of the wave. Loudness (also called sound
                    pressure level, or SPL) is measured in logarithmic units called decibels
                    (dB). The normal human ear can detect sounds that range between 0 dB
                    (hearing threshold) and about 140 dB, with sounds between 120dB and 140 dB
                    causing pain (pain threshold). The ambient SPL in a library is about 35
                    dB, while that inside a moving bus or subway train is roughly 85 dB;
                    building construction activities can generate SPLs as high as 105 dB at
                    the source. SPLs decrease with distance from the source. The rate at which
                    sound energy is transmitted, called sound intensity, is proportional to
                    the square of the SPL. Because of the logarithmic nature of the decibel
                    scale, an increase of 10 dB represents a 10-fold increase in sound
                    intensity, an increase of 20 dB represents a 100-fold increase in
                    intensity, a 30-dB increase represents a 1,000-fold increase in intensity,
                    and so on.

                When sound intensity is doubled, on the other hand, the SPL
                increases by only 3 dB. For example, if a construction drill causes a
                noise level of about 90 dB, then two identical drills operating side by
                side will cause a noise level of 93 dB. On the other hand, when two sounds
                that differ by more than 15 dB in SPL are combined, the weaker sound is
                masked (or drowned out) by the louder sound. For example, if an 80-dB
                drill is operating next to a 95-dB dozer at a construction site, the
                combined SPL of those two sources will be measured as 95 dB; the less
                intense sound from the compressor will not be noticeable. Frequency of a
                sound wave is expressed in cycles per second (cps), but hertz (Hz) is more
                commonly used (1 cps = 1 Hz). The human eardrum is a very sensitive organ
                with a large dynamic range, being able to detect sounds at frequencies as
                low as 20 Hz (a very low pitch) up to about 20,000 Hz (a very high pitch).
                The pitch of a human voice in normal conversation occurs at frequencies
                between 250 Hz and 2,000 Hz.

                <p>
                    Noise is more than a mere nuisance. At certain levels and durations of
                    exposure, it can cause physical damage to the eardrum and the sensitive
                    hair cells of the inner ear and result in temporary or permanent hearing
                    loss. Hearing loss does not usually occur at SPLs below 80 dBA (eight-hour
                    exposure levels are best kept below 85 dBA), but most people repeatedly
                    exposed to more than 105 dBA will have permanent hearing loss to some
                    extent. In addition to causing hearing loss, excessive noise exposure can
                    also raise blood pressure and pulse rates, cause irritability, anxiety,
                    and mental fatigue, and interfere with sleep, recreation, and personal
                    communication. Noise pollution control is therefore of importance in the
                    workplace and in the community. Noise-control ordinances and laws enacted
                    at the local, regional, and national levels can be effective in mitigating
                    the adverse effects of noise pollution. Environmental and industrial noise
                    is regulated in the United States under the Occupational Safety and Health
                    Act of 1970 and the Noise Control Act of 1972. Under these acts, the
                    Occupational Safety and Health Administration set up industrial noise
                    criteria in order to provide limits on the intensity of sound exposure and
                    on the time duration for which that intensity may be allowed.
