                <p>
                    Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air that are
                    detrimental to human health and the planet as a whole. The Clean Air Act
                    authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to protect
                    public health by regulating the emissions of these harmful air pollutants.
                    The NRDC has been a leading authority on this law since it was established
                    in 1970.

                    “Most air pollution comes from energy use and production,” says John
                    Walke, director of the Clean Air Project, part of the Climate and Clean
                    Air program at NRDC. “Burning fossil fuels releases gases and chemicals
                    into the air.” And in an especially destructive feedback loop, air
                    pollution not only contributes to climate change but is also exacerbated
                    by it. “Air pollution in the form of carbon dioxide and methane raises the
                    earth’s temperature,” Walke says. “Another type of air pollution is then
                    worsened by that increased heat: Smog forms when the weather is warmer and
                    there’s more ultraviolet radiation.” Climate change also increases the
                    production of allergenic air pollutants including mold (thanks to damp
                    conditions caused by extreme weather and increased flooding) and pollendue
                    to a longer pollen season and more pollen production

                    While we’ve made progress over the last 40-plus years improving air
                    quality in the U.S. thanks to the Clean Air Act, climate change will make
                    it harder in the future to meet pollution standards, which are designed to
                    protect health,” says Kim Knowlton, senior scientist and deputy director
                    of the NRDC Science Center.

                <h3>Smog and soot : </h3>
                <p>
                    soot These two are the most prevalent types of air pollution. Smog, or
                    “ground-level ozone,” as it is more wonkily called, occurs when emissions
                    from combusting fossil fuels react with sunlight. Soot, or “particulate
                    matter,” is made up of tiny particles of chemicals, soil, smoke, dust, or
                    allergens, in the form of gas or solids, that are carried in the air. The
                    EPA’s “Plain English Guide to the Clean Air Act” states, “In many parts of
                    the United States, pollution has reduced the distance and clarity of what
                    we see by 70 percent.” The sources of smog and soot are similar. “Both
                    come from cars and trucks, factories, power plants, incinerators,
                    engines—anything that combusts fossil fuels such as coal, gas, or natural
                    gas,” Walke says. The tiniest airborne particles in soot—whether they’re
                    in the form of gas or solids—are especially dangerous because they can
                    penetrate the lungs and bloodstream and worsen bronchitis, lead to heart
                    attacks, and even hasten death. Smog can irritate the eyes and throat and
                    also damage the lungs—especially of people who work or exercise outside,
                    children, and senior citizens. It’s even worse for people who have asthma
                    or allergies—these extra pollutants only intensify their symptoms and can
                    trigger asthma attacks

                    These are either deadly or have severe health risks even in small amounts.
                    Almost 200 are regulated by law; some of the most common are mercury,
                    lead, dioxins, and benzene. “These are also most often emitted during gas
                    or coal combustion, incinerating, or in the case of benzene, found in
                    gasoline,” Walke says. Benzene, classified as a carcinogen by the EPA, can
                    cause eye, skin, and lung irritation in the short term and blood disorders
                    in the long term. Dioxins, more typically found in food but also present
                    in small amounts in the air, can affect the liver in the short term and
                    harm the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems, as well as reproductive
                    functions. Lead in large amounts can damage children’s brains and kidneys,
                    and even in small amounts it can affect children’s IQ and ability to
                    learn. Mercury affects the central nervous system. Polycyclic aromatic
                    hydrocarbons, or PAHs, are toxic components of traffic exhaust and
                    wildfire smoke. In large amounts, they have been linked to eye and lung
                    irritation, blood and liver issues, and even cancer. In one recent study,
                    the children of mothers who’d had higher PAH exposure during pregnancy had
                    slower brain processing speeds and worse symptoms of ADHD.
